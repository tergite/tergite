# Contributing to tergite

**This project is currently not accepting pull requests from the general public yet.**

**It is currently being developed by the core developers only.**

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy
and transparent as possible, whether it's:

-   Reporting a bug
-   Discussing the current state of the code
-   Submitting a fix
-   Proposing new features
-   Becoming a maintainer

## Government Model

[Chalmers Next Labs AB (CNL)](https://chalmersnextlabs.se) manages and maintains this project on behalf of all contributors.

## Version Control

Tergite is developed on a separate version control system and mirrored on Github.
If you are reading this on GitHub, then you are looking at a mirror.

## Versioning

When versioning we follow the format `{year}.{month}.{patch_number}` e.g. `2023.12.0`.

## Contacting the Tergite Developers

Since the Github repositories are only mirrors, no Github pull requests or Github issue/bug reports
are looked. Please get in touch via email <quantum.nextlabs@chalmers.se> instead.

Take note that the maintainers may not answer every email.

## But We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we
use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull
requests:

1. Clone the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache 2.0 Software Licenses

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the
same [Apache 2.0 License](./LICENSE.txt) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626).
Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## How to Test

-   Make sure you have [python +3.12](https://www.python.org/) installed (or you could use [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install) or [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install python +3.12).

-   Clone the repo and enter its root folder

``` shell
git clone git@github.com:tergite/tergite.git
cd tergite
```

- Create and activate a virtual environment

Using conda:

```shell
conda create -n tergite-sdk python=3.12
conda activate tergite-sdk
```

Using installed python:

```shell
python3.12 -m venv env 
source env/bin/activate
```

-   Install the dependencies

``` shell
pip install ."[test]"
```

-   Run the tests command

``` shell
pytest tests
```

## How to Run End-to-end Tests

- Ensure you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed
- Ensure nothing is running on ports:
  - 27018
  - 8000
  - 8002
  - 8001
  - 6378

- Run the tests command

``` shell
FRONTEND_REPO="https://github.com/tergite/tergite-frontend.git" \
  BACKEND_REPO="https://github.com/tergite/tergite-backend.git" \
# BACKEND_BRANCH="main" \ # you can set a different backend branch; default is 'main'
# FRONTEND_BRANCH="main" \ # you can set a different frontend branch; default is 'main'
# DEBUG="True" \ # Set 'True' to avoid cleaning up the containers, env, and repos after test, default: ''
# PYTHON_IMAGE="python:3.9-slim" \ # Set the docker image to run the tests. If not provided, it runs on the host machine
./e2e_test.sh
```
